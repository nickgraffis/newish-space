## Workstation set up
* Macbook Pro 16in (2019) - _I actually just had my laptop stolen in January of 2021, so my new laptop is a replacement of that and I love it_.
    * 2.6 GHz, 6-Core Intel Core i7
    * 32 GB 2667 MHz
* 2 LG 27in Monitors
* Apple Magic Keyboard
* Apple Magic Mouse 2
* Apple Magic Trackpad 2
* 2 LG 27in UHD (3840 x 2160) IPS Displays
* [SHW Sit/Stand Desk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GVRKCWP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - _A super reasonable price, easy to build, works great_.
* [Brydge Vertical Dock](https://www.brydge.com/products/macbook-vertical-dock) - _Really looks great, and frees up a ton of desk space_.
* Aluratek - 1080 HD Webcam - _This isn't great, but I didn't want anything too fancy or expensive. Just for zoom_.
## Development
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - I jumped between Sublime and Atom for a long time, then got bullied by some friends into VS Code. It works fast, doesn't crash, and has a ton of great features out of the box. It's awesome.
    * [Git Lense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
    * [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) - If you use Angular, you'll love this. It gives you autocomplete inside your html templates. :mindblown:
    * [Grammarly](https://github.com/znck/grammarly) - Grammarly is awesome, this plugin is a great idea and it works pretty well, but may need some time to get perfect.
* [iTerm](https://iterm2.com)/[Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
    * [Fig :pear:](https://fig.io) - Really cool autocomplete for all things in the terminal.
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) - VS Code can do this for you, but Insomnia has some cool features like saving different environments and credintials.
* [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com) - For everything...
## Hosting
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - The only thing I really am using right now for personal sties.
* Heroku - _Used for projects that require a server, but I love the development flow of Netlify so much more..._
* [FaunaDB](https://www.fauna.com/fauna) - Serverless database and query language.
* [Air Table](https://airtable.com) - Super simple tables with a pretty good API and UI.
## Other Software
* [Loom](https://www.loom.com) - Pretty simple and easy for screen casts and asynchronous work. 
* [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com) - I good not much at grammar and speeleing.
## Random Tech
* Apple Airpods Pro
* [Timeular](https://timeular.com/) - Pretty cool tool for time tracking.
* Tesla Model 3 ‚ö°Ô∏è üòª
## Office Space
### I spent a couple months in the summer of 2020 building my own office from an old tool shed in my backyard. It turned out great!
1. Reframed the old toolshed door area and installed a Pella sliding glass door.
2. Added cotton/denium insulation across all the walls.
3. Wired the place up with 4 outlets and 2 sections of overhead lighting.
4. Threw up some drywall and gave it a nice paint job.
