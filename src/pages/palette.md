# Love Color?
The color palette options used for this website. You can toggle from theme to theme with <kbd>⌘ →</kbd> & <kbd>⌘ ←</kbd>. You can toggle between light and dark mode of each theme with <kbd>⌘ ↑</kbd> & <kbd>⌘ ↓</kbd>.

## Variable Conventions
The variables, back, middle, and front refer to background colors. Primary, secondary, tertiary, muted refer to text and component colors. Rose, corn, and grass are special colors. And highlight-primary is used for highlighting text.

## Code Syntax Highlighting
I'm using an opinionated fork of [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) called [Fuyu-Shiki-Twoslash]() for syntax highlighting. And [Shiki-Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) for typescript code blocks. The theme for all code blocks, no matter what theme you are looking at in the site is Dracula right now.

The font is [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).
