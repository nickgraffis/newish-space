        Dear to my heart, my first web app project while taking CS50x. It went
        from vanilla js to now a React app with TailwindCSS and serverless
        functions with Netlify. Application accepts a query and finds images
        from UnSplash that match the query, but more importantly, finds the
        k-means clustering of those image's colors. You get back, quickly, the
        main color and a 6 part color palette.

  #       A simple resume site built with Vite and handlebars. It uses JSON to
  #       store the resume data, base on the JSON Resume standard. It's styled
  #       with WindiCSS, and uses pupeteer to generate a PDFs of the resume's at
  #       build time. You can create multiple resumes quickly by having a new
  #       directory for each resume. It will use the same template, just add in a
  #       new resume.json and index.html.
